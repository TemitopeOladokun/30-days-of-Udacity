2. Completed Lesson 1 on deep learning nanodegree class.
3. Revisited mlcourses.ai lesson on DEcision Trees and Random Forest.

4. Watched Siraj Raval video on Decision Forest and Random Forest for clarity

## WHAT I LEARNT
* The collection of Decision Tree is Random Forest
* Random Forest used for both Classification and Regression problem
* Random Forest is good for small dataset.
* Broadened my knowledge on Matrix multiplication and Matrix dot product
* Decision tree is prone to error and it is instable



## Day 2 : 27/09/2019
1. I started Introduction to Neural Networks
2. Broadened my knowledge on Perceptron    https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/perceptron
3. Watched a video on step function    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHwpj9b4zZo

### WHAT I LEARNT
* The heart of deep learning is Neural Network 
* Neural networks have nodes, edges, layers
* Perceptron is an algorithm for binary classifier. It consist of foru main parts : Inptu values, Weights and biases, net sum and an activation function
* Another name for Perception is Linear Binary Classifier
* Default equation:
                    ##Equation = Wx + Bias
                    W = Weights
                    x = Values
                    B = Bias 



## Day 3 : 28/09/2019
1. Read about the cost function equation
