# 30-days-of-Udacity

## Day 1 : 26/09/2019
1. I took the pledge #30daysofUdacity in my Deep Learning Nanodegree.
![](https://github.com/TemitopeOladokun/30-days-of-Udacity/blob/master/Screenshot%20(244).png)
2. Completed Lesson 1 on deep learning nanodegree class.
3. Revisited mlcourses.ai lesson on DEcision Trees and Random Forest.

4. Watched Siraj Raval video on Decision Forest and Random Forest for clarity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHOazyP-YlM

## WHAT I LEARNT
* The collection of Decision Tree is Random Forest
* Random Forest used for both Classification and Regression problem
* Random Forest is good for small dataset.
* Broadened my knowledge on Matrix multiplication and Matrix dot product
* Decision tree is prone to error and it is instable



## Day 2 : 27/09/2019
1. I started Introduction to Neural Networks
2. Broadened my knowledge on Perceptron    https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/perceptron
3. Watched a video on step function    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHwpj9b4zZo

### WHAT I LEARNT
* The heart of deep learning is Neural Network 
* Neural networks have nodes, edges, layers
* Perceptron is an algorithm for binary classifier. It consist of foru main parts : Inptu values, Weights and biases, net sum and an activation function
* Another name for Perception is Linear Binary Classifier
* Default equation:
                    ##Equation = Wx + Bias
                    W = Weights
                    x = Values
                    B = Bias 



## Day 3 : 28/09/2019
1. Read about the cost function equation
2. I learnt categories of model in Data Science
3. Different between local and global minimum   https://statinfer.com/204-5-10-local-vs-global-minimum/


### WHAT I LEARNT
* The co-efficient of a bias is 1
* If the question is to determine probability of a dataset. Use Predictive Model
* If the question is to show relationship of a dataset. Use Descriptive Model
* If the question requires Yes or No answer of a dataset. Use Classification Model
* Matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. Mathematically : Matrix = M x N
* Vector is a N x 1 matrix


## Day 4: 29/09/2019
1. Lesson 1:12 - Non- Linear Region
2. Lesson 1:13 - Error Function
3. Lesson 1:14 - Softmax
4. Broadened my knowledge about softmax   https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/multi-class-neural-networks/softmax

### WHAT I LEARNT
* Error function is used to detect how close we are to the goal
* Error function must be differentiable
* Error function must be continuous bot discrete
* Predictions are answers gotten from Algorithm
* Converting step function to discrete is by using another activation function called Sigmoid function
* Softmax is another word for normalization of numbers
* To be proficint in AI, you need to be proficient in Object Oriented Programming


## Day 5: 30/09/2019
1. Completed Lesson 1
2. Started Lesson 2
3. Explicit video of One-Hot Encoding  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_4KWmkwmsU 
4. Watched this video image classifier https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAICT4Al5Ow




## Day 6: 01/10/2019
1. Completed Lesson 2 - Implementing Gradient Descent
2. Started and Completed Lesson 3 - Training neural networks


                        
## Day 7: 02/10/2019
1. Trying to Style Trasnfer my picture but not working. Trying to fix the error
2. Started Lesson 4 
3. Read a little about style Transfer


## DAY 8: 03/10/2019
1.	Completed Lesson 1
2.	Viewed my first project â€“ Predicting Bike share pattern


### WHAT I LEARNT
* Difference between Underfitting and Overfitting
* What is Regularization? 
* L1 and L2 Regularization
* Dropout is the solution to Overfitting
* Random Restart is use to solve the problem of local minimum
* Other Activation function aside Sigmoid. They are Hyperbolic Tangent Function and Rectified Linear Unit (RELU) Function
