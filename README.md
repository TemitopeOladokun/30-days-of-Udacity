## WHAT I LEARNT
* The collection of Decision Tree is Random Forest
* Random Forest used for both Classification and Regression problem
* Random Forest is good for small dataset.
* Broadened my knowledge on Matrix multiplication and Matrix dot product
* Decision tree is prone to error and it is instable


## Day 2 : 27/09/2019
